## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use a unicode character for the red dot and to center it vertically.

```css
.unread-dot {
    font-size: 0.625rem;
    vertical-align: text-top;
    line-height: 2.15;
```

### Continued development

Practice, practice, practice...
